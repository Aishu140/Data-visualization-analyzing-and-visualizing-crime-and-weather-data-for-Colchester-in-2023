# Data-visualization-analyzing-and-visualizing-crime-and-weather-data-for-Colchester-in-2023
This project explores the relationship between crime incidents and temperature variations in Colchester for the year 2023. The analysis uses two datasets: crime23.csv (crime incidents) and temp2023.csv (temperature data). The goal is to identify trends, correlations, and potential influences of temperature on crime rates.
1. Crime Distribution
Violent crimes and anti-social behavior were the most common types of crimes in Colchester in 2023.

Less frequent crimes included bicycle theft, robbery, and theft from the person.

2. Temperature Analysis
The average daily temperatures followed a normal-like distribution, with most days experiencing moderate temperatures (5°C to 15°C).

Extreme temperatures (below 0°C or above 20°C) were less common.
Pie Chart: Crime Distribution
The pie chart illustrates the distribution of different crime categories in Colchester for 2023. The largest slice represents violent crimes, which were the most frequently reported, followed by anti-social behavior. Less common crimes, such as bicycle theft, robbery, and theft from the person, made up smaller portions of the chart. This visualization highlights the dominance of violent and anti-social crimes in the dataset, suggesting these are the primary areas of concern for law enforcement.

Histogram: Average Daily Temperatures
The histogram shows the frequency distribution of average daily temperatures in Colchester for 2023. The data follows a bell-shaped curve, with most days experiencing moderate temperatures between 5°C and 15°C. Extreme temperatures, both below 0°C and above 20°C, were less frequent. This indicates that Colchester has a temperate climate, with fewer days of extreme weather conditions.

Scatter Plot: Crime Count vs. Temperature
The scatter plot explores the relationship between average temperature and crime rates. Each point represents the total number of crimes for a given month plotted against the average temperature. A positive trend is visible, suggesting that as temperatures increase, crime rates also tend to rise. The regression line and shaded confidence interval further emphasize this correlation, though it’s important to note that correlation does not imply causation.

Time Series Plot: Crime Trends Over Time
The time series plot tracks the number of crimes reported each month in 2023. The plot reveals seasonal patterns, with crime rates peaking during the warmer months (e.g., summer) and declining during colder periods. This trend aligns with the observed correlation between temperature and crime, suggesting that environmental factors may influence criminal activity.

Interactive Leaflet Map: Crime Locations
The interactive Leaflet map provides a geospatial visualization of crime incidents across Colchester. Each marker on the map represents a reported crime, and users can click on the markers to view details such as the type of crime and its outcome status. The map reveals crime hotspots, helping identify areas with higher crime rates. This tool is valuable for both law enforcement and the public, as it offers a clear visual representation of crime distribution in the city.
The analysis revealed a positive correlation between temperature and crime rates in Colchester, with higher crime rates during warmer months. Seasonal trends and spatial patterns were identified, providing valuable insights for law enforcement and policymakers. However, further research is needed to establish causality and explore additional factors influencing crime rates.
